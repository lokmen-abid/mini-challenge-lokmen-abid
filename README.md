# mini-challenge-lokmen-abid

Before Start coding i try to think of the architecture and functionalities that i want to use. 
The first step i took a look at the  Online REST API , i found that it miss tow links for the Products 
and Categories, i mailed you about it and i hope you get my e_mail well . 

The second step i thought of what each and every component should be and what state should it hold. 

The Third step i took look at the Material UI and i tried to use it . It contain a lot of Components 
that need a little time and a good practice that will make the App with Simple and Beautifull design.

I start my project with npx create-react-app 
I installed the dependencies that i used "react-router react-router-dom axios material ui (core/icons/datagrid)

I create the Folder assets that contain the Header 
I create the Folder Components that contain the components that i use it and i try it to separte each component in folder 

I took sometime searching for the ErrorBoundary and the Loader page that i use for the first time . 


For the Improvements : the first thing the design need a lot of improvements , if i took more time to undrestand the Material UI and practice it i will do other design for sure. 
For the functionalities could contain some improvements 


The Main challenge for me was to finish this project only in 4 hours maybe if i took the whole time in last previous tow days i could do better
